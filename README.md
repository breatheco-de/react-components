This is the main UI Library used in all BreatheCode interfaces based on react. Click here to see the [live demo](https://breatheco-de.github.io/react-components/)

## Philosophy

The BreatheCode UX is based on Markdown, it relays heavily on typography to create a neat experience but with a very minimalis approach.
