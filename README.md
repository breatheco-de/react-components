This is the main UI Library used in all BreatheCode interfaces based on react.
> Note: This is a very early development library, please help us debug it.

## Philosophy

The BreatheCode UX is based on Markdown, it relays heavily on typography to create a neat experience but with a very minimalis approach.

## Instalation

1. Install using npm
```
$ npm i @breathecode/ui-components --save
```
2. Import any component that you want to use
```
import { Panel, DropLink } from '@breathecode/ui-components';
```
